# NO2-VOC-code
This is the code for the simulations in our project: The Impact of Nitrogen Dioxide and Common Volatile Organic Compounds on the Production of Ozone: A Comparative Analysis under Artificial and Natural UV Light
I have no idea why you would need this but it should have some cool particle simulations. Please enjoy
